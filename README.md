# RecipeApp
Demo iOS app for a talk at the Paris Android User Group

## Purpose of the app
This iOS app is a recipe application. You can search a term, then choose a recipe to see its instructions.
RecipeApp is intended to be a demo about Objective C for iOS. That is why the architecture of the project could be better. 
But I have chosen to implement this app like that to show multiple ways to achieve the same thing (for example do a background task).

## How to run
To run this sample, you need to have XCode correctly installed. 
The app is based on the [bigoven API](http://api.bigoven.com/). So you have to get a **free API key [here](http://www.bigoven.com/account/facebook)**.
Then, you will need to **add this API key in the [Helper.m file](https://github.com/djavan-bertrand/RecipeApp/blob/master/RecipeApp/Helper.m)** of the project.


## Slides of the talk
A link to the slides of the talk will be added soon.
